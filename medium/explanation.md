## Problem Statement
The countCompleteComponents method takes in an integer n, representing the number of vertices in a graph, and an array edges, representing the edges between these vertices. The goal is to count the number of complete components in the graph. A component is complete if every node in the component is connected to every other node in the component.

## Breakdown of the Code

### 1. **Graph Representation Using Adjacency Lists**
java
List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];

An adjacency list graph is initialized, where each index represents a vertex, and the list at that index contains its neighbors.

java
for (int vertex = 0; vertex < n; vertex++) {
    graph[vertex] = new ArrayList<>();
    graph[vertex].add(vertex);
}

Each vertex is initialized with a self-loop (though this is not necessary for the algorithm).

### 2. **Building the Adjacency Lists from the Edges**
java
for (int[] edge : edges) {
    graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
    graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
}

Each edge connects two vertices, so both endpoints of the edge are added to each other's adjacency list.

### 3. **Counting Unique Adjacency Patterns**
java
Map<List<Integer>, Integer> componentFreq = new HashMap<>();

A HashMap componentFreq is used to store unique adjacency lists and their frequency.

java
for (int vertex = 0; vertex < n; vertex++) {
    List<Integer> neighbors = graph[vertex];
    Collections.sort(neighbors);
    componentFreq.put(
        neighbors,
        componentFreq.getOrDefault(neighbors, 0) + 1
    );
}

Each adjacency list is sorted to ensure consistency in representation. The frequency of each unique adjacency pattern is counted.

### 4. **Counting Complete Components**
java
int completeCount = 0;
for (Map.Entry<List<Integer>, Integer> entry : componentFreq.entrySet()) {
    if (entry.getKey().size() == entry.getValue()) {
        completeCount++;
    }
}

A component is considered complete if the number of vertices in the adjacency list equals its frequency in the HashMap.

### 5. **Returning the Result**
java
return completeCount;

The method returns the count of complete components.
